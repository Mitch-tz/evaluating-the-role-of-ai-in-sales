# Evaluating the Role of AI in B2B Sales: Enhancing Customer Relationship Management Task Completion with Generative AI Assistance
This repository contains a synthetic dataset developed as part of a master's thesis on the task-level evaluation of a generative AI (GenAI) tool in B2B sales contexts. The dataset was used to simulate realistic CRM scenarios for qualitative experiments involving sales professionals.

## Background
The dataset supports research on how GenAI can assist sales representatives in completing CRM-related tasks (e.g. account summarization, product positioning, lead prioritization). It was designed to resemble the structure of a typical enterprise CRM system while avoiding any use of real or sensitive data.

## Dataset Contents
- **accounts.csv**: synthetic account data with fictive companies including names, industries, sizes, etc.
- **contacts.csv**: contact details linked to accounts
- **opportunities.csv**: sales opportunities linked to accounts and products
- **products.csv**: product catalog entries with features and categories (based on public data of Elsevier products)
- **trials.csv**: product trial activity by account and product

All datasets were programmatically generated using GenAI with public data sources and do not contain private personal or organizational data.

## Limitations
- This is a fully synthetic dataset and may not reflect the complexity or data diversity found in real CRM systems.
- The dataset is designed for controlled, illustrative tasks rather than production-grade modeling or performance benchmarking.
